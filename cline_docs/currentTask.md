# Current Task: Mobile-First Strategy List View Implementation

## Current Objectives
- Implement a mobile-first strategy list view as shown in the provided design
- Ensure all components are optimized for mobile and tablet devices
- Create reusable components that can be used throughout the application

## Context
We are transitioning from the prototype phase to building the actual user interface. The focus is on creating a mobile-first design that works well on smaller screens. The first page to implement is the strategy list view, which allows users to select a trading strategy to build their bot.

## Components to Implement
1. **Account Header**
   - Account type selector (Real/Demo dropdown)
   - Account balance display
   - Deposit button

2. **Page Title Section**
   - "Create bot" title
   - Instructional subtitle

3. **Strategy List**
   - Strategy cards with:
     - Robot icon
     - Strategy name
     - Strategy description
     - Navigation chevron

4. **Bottom Navigation**
   - Discover (active)
   - Bots
   - Positions
   - Menu

## Next Steps
1. Create/modify the mobile-friendly header component
2. Implement the strategy list component with proper styling
3. Create the bottom navigation bar
4. Ensure responsive behavior across different screen sizes
5. Test the implementation on various device sizes
